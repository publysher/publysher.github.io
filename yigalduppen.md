I am an experienced software architect and developer of web applications written in Java and Python. Through my strong theoretical background I know a bit about everything, and my years of experience ensure that I know everything about web application development.

I strongly believe in clear and focused communication: not just with the technical department, but also with the business and end-users.

My added value is strongest in small, result-oriented agile teams; my track record shows that in such projects I can provide production-quality solutions in a very short time span.
