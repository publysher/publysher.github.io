This new project aimed to help customers gain insight in their financial situation; the first goal was to show the tradeoffs between extra mortgage repayments and savings deposits. The application consisted of two parts: a REST API and an HTML5 front-end.

In the beginning, I was solely responsible for setting up the front-end and integrating it with the existing AngularJS components of other teams. As the team grew, my focus shifted to the design and integration of the REST endpoints.
