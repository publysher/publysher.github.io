The municipality of Amsterdam wanted to rebuild their internal geo information system called Atlas. This tool is used throughout the 
organisation for information gathering and decision making. 

As the first developer on the team it was my task to set up a complete environment that transforms legacy import files into a modern, 
responsive set of web applications to provide this information, and assist in setting up a full development team.
