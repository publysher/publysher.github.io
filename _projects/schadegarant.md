This project provides a vertical integration between insurance companies, intermediaries and (chains of) car body shops. By providing a fully automated workflow of all the relevant information and combining this with technical and statistical analysis, this product lowers the car damage repair costs and overhead.

As the eventual technical team lead and architect, I was responsible for the technical coherency of the entire project. I defined the initial data model, the initial WSDLs and the project architecture, developed a large part of the system and was involved in the go-live of the first two public versions. After that, I remained associated with the project in an advisory role.
