The sector association for pharmacies provides its members with clinical rules that can be used in monitoring drug use. This project is a web application providing a content management system for such clinical rules; combining an intuitive interface with an enforced audit cycle, the association can quickly encode the rulesets and be assured of their quality.

Apart from helping to develop the system, one of my main tasks was to use progressive enhancement on the web application and provide a modern and intuitive user interface. By developing in short sprints and continuously discussing the result with the end users, the resulting interface is widely appreciated.
