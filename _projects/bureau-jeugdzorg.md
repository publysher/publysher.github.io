The customer is planning to migrate to a new system; over the last few years, the big picture of the required system has slowly emerged, but it turned out that the actual future users of the system still had a lot of questions. Before embarking on a public tender, the customer decided to create a prototype of the system and validate its interface with the intended users.

Together with a user interface designer I was responsible for developing the prototype. Using an iterative approach, we quickly refined the prototype and solicited feedback from the focus group. In the end, the focus group felt that we had completely understood their current problems and that we had provided a compelling product. This prototype is now used as the starting point for the public tender.
