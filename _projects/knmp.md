This project provides the primary channel for health-care insurance companies to inform pharmacies on the renumeration on drugs. The two greatest challenges in this project were the size of the datasets, solved by using batch processing, and the integration with the existing data warehouse.

Together with the visual and interaction designer I was responsible for gathering the requirements, designing the application, implementing the project and delivering the final product.
