Admarkt provides paid listings on various platforms such as Marktplaats and Kijiji. It is a micro-service architecture written 
mostly in Go, with some legacy code in Java. 

I was initially hired to assist in ongoing development, but soon became a major contributor on their new cloud-native prototyping 
platform that is based on an event driven architecture using Kafka as the underlying event storage. My experience with DevOps and Docker 
proved valuable in getting everything to production.
