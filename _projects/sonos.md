The customer exposes their online radio services on Sonos devices through an existing gateway application. They required new functionality to bring the Sonos experience more in line with their own mobile app. 

I was responsible for mapping the new features on the possibilities provided by the Sonos API; to implement these new features in a timely manner; and to drastically improve the performance of the gateway application.
