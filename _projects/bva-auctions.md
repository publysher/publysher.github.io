Since its inception, the auction site had grown enormously in both functionality, users and interactions, but the base design was more or less the same; by the time I got hired as an architecture consultant, it had become clear that the original design could no longer support further growth. 

Based on the current system, I designed an event-based microservice architecture and described some possible migration paths. Since then, the team has been slowly upgrading the application to the new architecture.
