This new intranet project aimed to establish a corporate identity across all the customer's subsidiaries and to improve cooperation between them. It combines elements of social media with classical intranet solutions and is aimed at a world-wide audience.

My primary task was to provide the roadmap on how to massage IBM Web Content Manager into the required designs and functionality. The project architecture relied heavily on the new WCM 7 plugin architecture; combined with liberal use of progressive enhancement, this enabled my team to implement the entire first release in three months.
