Initially, this project was meant to be the new and improved version of the customer's congress management software. During development, the customer realized he wanted a totally new event management experience and decided to brand this as a totally new product. The project's public beta was launched in november 2011 at a trade fair.

I was involved with this project from the beginning and proposed to manage this project using Scrum because of the vague requirements. In the sprints that followed I was the lead architect and played a large part in managing the customer's requirements. I was responsible for the initial data models and project architecture and together with my team managed to realize the customer's vision.
