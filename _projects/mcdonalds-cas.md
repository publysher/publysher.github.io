This project was a redesign of an existing course management system. Internal courses are an important part of the career path of this customer's employees, but administering the courses was cumbersome and non-intuitive. 

The new project provided a fresh user-centered interface and several new reporting possibilities.
As the project's architect, I was responsible for setting up the project architecture and implementing part of it.
