The Dutch subsidiary of this company has always been at the front-line of IT-based innovations. For their new online strategy they had decided on a combination of WebSphere Portal and IBM Web Content Management. This was combined with an internal deadline of three months.

My team consisted of a project manager, an infrastructure engineer and myself. Together we managed to complete the website, intranet and extranet in time. After this, I assisted in training the support team to maintain the solution.
