The goal of this project was to improve the efficiency of the customer's invoicing process. Before this project was released, the invoicing process took at least one day to run, after which it would take the administration department another few days to calculate remittances and clear up financial inconsistencies. 

This project reduced the total process to two hours of invoicing, including separate remittance reports.

As part of the technical pre-sales I was responsible for the requirements analysis and the batch architecture. By defining sanitized views on the business' Oracle database and carefully describing each step in the batch process, my team was able to complete this project successfully. The administration department was more than satisfied with the result.
