Although most of the online experience had been upgraded over the past few years, the customer's self-care environment hadn't been improved in ages. This project aimed to consolidate the self-care environment with the customer's other online environments.

This was the first experience with a strict Scrum approach for both the customer and the team. Although I was hired for this project as an additional backend programmer, my previous experiences with Scrum proved very valuable to the team.
