Due to the acquisition of a French subsidiary, the customer needed to make its business critical portal environment available to the French market. Go-live was tied to a bonus-malus, making this a high-visibility project within the organization.

As it turned out, the analysis on which the bonus-malus was based had some major oversights. I made a few proposals that balanced 'quick and dirty' solutions with future-proof solutions; these proposals were accepted by the company's architecture group and I managed to complete the project on schedule.
